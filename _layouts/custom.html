        I'm Daniel Hadzajlic, an aspiring games programmer currently completing my Advanced Diploma of Professional Game Development at AIE. Right now my favourite language is c++ and 
        although I enjoy every aspect of games programming, I'm particularly interested in network programming in multiplayer games.
