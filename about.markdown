Hi, I'm Daniel Hadzajlic. I'm currently completing my Advanced Diploma of Professional Game Development at AIE. Right now my favourite language is C++
	and although I enjoy every aspect of games programming, I'm particularly interested in network programming for multiplayer games.
	
	I love playing video games and currently I'm into Neverwinter Nights 1.
