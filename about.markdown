I'm Daniel Hadzajlic, an aspiring games programmer currently completing my Advanced Diploma of Professional Game Development at AIE. Right now my favourite language is c++
	and although I enjoy every aspect of games programming, I'm particularly interested in network programming for multiplayer games.
	
	I've always loved video games ever since I was young. It's been a long time and it's hard to remember but I think my brother first introduced me to games. I remember playing games like The Legend
	of Zelda Ocarina of Time and Banjo Kazooie on my brothers Nintendo 64, which at the time was an old console. Pretty soon after that I found myself playing online multiplayer games, most notably, World of Warcraft
	and Club Penguin. I remember being amazed at how I could play a game and see all these other people, real people, being in the same virtual world as me.

    During my time at AIE we learned C# and C++. I enjoy working in both languages but if I were to choose a favourite one, I would pick C++. Theres just something special about writing code in C++, I'm not sure
		if it's the ability to work with pointers or the syntax or maybe getting to write a heap of #include's at the top of every cpp file, it just feels a bit more fun in my opinion.
		
		A lot of the time, when I write programs, I like to try and write them from as-scratch as I can. An example of one project like this, which you can find on my websites front page, is my networking library written
		using the Microsoft Winsock2 api. The library is called DanNet and isn't the greatest networking library out there, but it was written by me and can successfully send packets via UDP sockets across the internet.
		
		But although I do like writing things from the ground-up, I do use pre-made tools and libraries a lot of the time. Sometimes I feel like making a game and just a game. That feeling of
		thinking of a cool, simple game and then writing it up and being able to show it to others as quickly as possible is something that game engines make possible. I have a few examples of these
		types of projects on my front page aswell.
